## Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

## Business Problem

**Can you develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified?**

## Dataset Story

**The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA.***

***Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA.***

***Consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable is specified as "outcome";***

***--1 diabetes test result being positive,***

***--0 indicates that it is negative.***

## Variables


***Pregnancies – Number of pregnancies***

***Glucose – Glucose***

***---2 hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test***

***Blood Pressure (mm Hg)***

***SkinThickness – Skin Thickness***

**Insulin – 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)**

***BMI: Body mass index***

**DiabetesPedigreeFunction: – Function**

**---2 hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test***

***Age – Age (years)***

***Outcome: Have the disease (1) or not (0)***

## Mission

***Develop a diabetes prediction model by performing literature research, data preprocessing and feature engineering.***
